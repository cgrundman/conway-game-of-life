This repository was built under the idea of [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). You can read more at the link. But fundamentally, TDD is developing only after defining and writing a test for the functionality you want to implement. Pytest was used as it is an easy-to-use library for creating unit tests.
